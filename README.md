# GeometricMultigridPressureSolver

This is a geometric multigrid solver for a standard scalar poisson problem that is typically used to solve for pressure in fluids simulations. It is based on McAdams et al., 2010 and built as a plug-in to Houdini 18.

## TO-DO
1. Introduce mixed precision according to Narrow-Band Topology Optimization on a Sparsely Populated Grid [Liu et al., 2018]
